<p>Artificial intelligence or AI is a popular buzzword youâ€™ve probably heard or read about.</p>
<p>&nbsp; AI technology is improving enterprise performance and productivity by automating processes or tasks that once required human power.</p>

<p>&nbsp;For example, AI in driving---self driving!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Society of Automotive Engineers (SAE) currently defines 6 levels of driving automation ranging from Level 0 (fully manual) to Level 5 (fully autonomous). These levels have been adopted by the U.S. Department of Transportation.</p>
<p>The most challenge of self driving car is fully autonomous(Level 5). People are still researhing it.&nbsp;The challenges range from the technological and legislative to the environmental and philosophical. Here are just some of the unknowns.</p>
